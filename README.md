# Prolog-Project-2
Second assignment project for Prolog Artificial intelligence .pl files are actual programs, while .txt files are testing queries and output

1. puzzle1.pl and puzzle2.pl are two versions of the same program, puzzle1 uses simple generate and test, 
    while puzzle2 uses interleaving generate and test for faster and more efficient computation.
    Both programs simply serve as a puzzle with a simple arithmetics using prolog to find the difference between two different methods and how it affects time and complexity

2. sportclub.pl is constraint related problem that uses different constraints to figure out who becomes President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer among possible 6 people
    in knowdledge base. 
    
3. tournament.pl is much more complex constraint satisfaction problem. Using known information about which team won what match in a particular round in the tournament
    program has to figure out final standing for teams in the tournament.
